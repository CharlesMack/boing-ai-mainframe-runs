# Caffeine_v1 – First Traceable Research Run
**Boing AI Quantum Research Mainframe v0.9** (conceptual virtual–physical twin)

**Date:** January 11–12, 2026  
**Purpose:** Benchmark high-level correlated electronic structure (gas phase, neutral singlet) as audit-ready example run.  
**Method:** Classical quantum chemistry reference (DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-TZVPP//ωB97X-D/def2-TZVP) — future target for hybrid quantum-classical advantage.
